# Go-skypebot
> A very basic framework for skype bot.
> No special feature like other official skype bot framework sdks like waterfalls etc.

# Feature-list/Todo
- [ ] Authentication handling, request and auto-renewals.
- [x] Cache for tokens and common urls
- [ ] Message template creation, not all message/rich message types are supported.
- [x] Bot Manager, managing multiple bot instances to support concurrency.
- [ ] I'll think for more.
